## Neovim Config

- I'd advice that you get inspired from this config but if you use the entierety of it it might change a lot on each git pull that you make.
- I use it on osx and nixos because I manage my tooling with nix. mason is installed regardless.
- My remaps are not very conventional, but they are documented in whichkey.
- This is the default neovim theme but with some changes.
